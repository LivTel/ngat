# Request RCS to switch between ENG and AUTO states.
# 
# If the RCS is in ENG state then AUTO will move it to INIT thence
# depending on conditions towards operationality.
#
# If the RCS is running operations or waiting on conditions, then ENG
# will return it immediately to ENG state.
#
# NOTE: Currently it will not perform any finalization or other tasks
#       but will abort a running MCA - (awaiting state model changes).
#
# The result of this command will be observable via subsequent ID responses.
#
# Module code: 680700
