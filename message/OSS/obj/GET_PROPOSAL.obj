#Command: GET_PROPOSAL
#Retreives a Proposal from the P2DB. The Proposal will be locked 
#with the specified key which will be required to unlock it when
#a subsequent EXPORT_PROPOSAL or REPLACE_PROPOSAL command is sent.
#The userId of the editor (i.e. the sender of this command) is saved
#in the Proposal record as lastEditor so others can see who has currently
#got the lock. If the Proposal is already locked this command fails and
#the uid and lock time of the current locker are returned.
