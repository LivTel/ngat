#Command: INIT_SCHEDULE
#Requests the OSS to start scheduled operations.
#The OSS may use the opportunity to carry out any caching results of
#regularly used but expensive calculations or searches. E.g. the
#sequence of FixedGroups over the (rest of) the night could be 
#determined and saved at this time.
