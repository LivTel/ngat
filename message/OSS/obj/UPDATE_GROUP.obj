#Command: UPDATE_GROUP
#Updates a Group's scheduling/execution history. Sent when a Group has
#been scheduled and either completes or fails for some reason. For a
#FlexibleGroup there may be many scheduled records but only one done record.
#For Monitor and Ephem Groups there can be many of each. For FixedGroups
#there should only be one record which may be done or failed.
#The owning Proposal and Tag have their respective block allocation times
#,total time and fixed time updated to reflect the time used only if the
#Group executed successfully. Proposals which have a freeTwilight allocation
#do not have these updated if it is currently twilight.
