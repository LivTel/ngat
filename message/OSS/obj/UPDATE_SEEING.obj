$UPDATE_SEEING;703501;Indicates that the data supplied is seeing data (arcsec)
$UPDATE_PHOTOM;703502;Indicates that the data supplied is photom data (mags)
$EXCELLENT;703503;that the seeing/photometricity is excellent.
$AVERAGE;703504;that the seeing/photometricity is average
$POOR;703505;that the  seeing/photometricity is poor
$UNKNOWN_TYPE;703501;that the type was unknown
%int;type;One of {UPDATE_SEEING | UPDATE_PHOTOM};Determines which type of data is supplied in 'values' array
%double[];values;An array of seeing/photom values (arcsec/mags) mapped to the times in 'times';The set of values to use for updating the model
%long[];times;A (sequential) array of times (millis);The set of times at which the 'values' array elements were taken.
