\section{Documentation Overview}
\subsection{What is the ngat.ccd package?}
These classes wrap the {\em libccd} library, using the JNI interface to communicate with the C routines.
The {\em libccd} library is a shared C library containing routines to communicate with the SDSU CCD Controller,
and perform setup, configuration and exposure functionality using this controller.
Documentation on {\em libccd} is available at \cite{bib:libccd}.

The ngat.ccd library consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item The CCDLibrary class.
\item The CCDLibraryDouble class.
\item The CCDLibraryFormatException class.
\item The CCDLibraryNativeException class.
\item The CCDLibrarySetupWindow class.
\end{itemize}

\section{Class Overview}
API documentation for these classes is available at \cite{bib:ngatccdapi}.

\subsection{The CCDLibrary class}
This is the main class of the package. It contains all the methods that actually send commands to the CCD Controller
hardware. A static code section in the class loads the {\em libccd} shared library, which must be present in the
{\em LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} for the class to be loaded.
The class has several main components:

\begin{itemize}
\item A set of public class constants, usually used as arguments to the methods. 
These are mainly re-definitions of constants
in the header files of {\em libccd}, and should be kept up to date with these definitions.
\item A set of private native methods. These have no implementation in Java, and when invoked call the
relevant C routine using the JNI interface. They are named identically with the C functions they call,
with underscores (`\_') in them. These calls of course go via the JNI code in {\em libccd}, which pack
and unpack the Java data to C. The JNI code in {\em libccd} also causes these routine to throw an instance of
CCDLibraryNativeException when the underlying {\em libccd} code returns an error value. This means {\em libccd}
error routines do not have to be invoked from the Java layer, an Exception is returned in response to errors
like `normal' Java methods.
\item A set of public methods. This is the main callable interface of this package. There is a public method
for each of the {\em libccd} routines wrapped by the library, which just invoke the underlying
private native method. Any CCDLibraryNativeException thrown in the native method is thrown up to the application
layer to deal with.
\item A set of public methods to parse string versions of the public constants mentioned above and return the
constant value. These are used to parse stored string versions of constants in configuration files.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The CCDLibraryDouble class}
This is a simple double class wrapper. This allows the Java application layer to pass an object of this
class as a parameter to a method, which sets the value of the wrapped double it contains. It is used for
the temperature getting methods.

\subsection{The CCDLibraryFormatException class}
This is an exception, which is thrown from the public parse methods in CCDLibrary when an unrecognised
string is passed to these methods.

\subsection{The CCDLibraryNativeException class}
This is an exception, which is thrown from all the public methods which call a native method that can fail.
This allows CCDLibrary to wrap the global error routines in {\em libccd}. The global error routines should not
be called from the Java layer, the native methods will automatically throw an instance of this class
when an error occurs in {\em libccd}.

\subsection{The CCDLibrarySetupWindow class}
This class allows us to specify the location of a window on the CCD chip. 
It is used as a parameter to the setup method that sets the windows on the controller. 

\section{Using the package}
\subsection{Threads}
The package is designed so that different methods can be invoked from different threads. This allows
operations such as the aborting of exposures, commands and readouts. The application layer must take care of
potential errors arising from say, trying to send a command to the DSP whilst a readout is in progress.

\subsection{Instantiation of CCDLibrary}
The package is designed so that an object of class CCDLibrary should be instantiated, rather than using class
methods in CCDLibrary. No more than one object of class CCDLibrary should be instantiated per piece of 
SDSU CCD Controller hardware, otherwise several processes may vie for control of same piece of hardware.
There is no mechanism to control this in the package. Class methods are not used in case one java JVM
should be responsible for several controllers.
