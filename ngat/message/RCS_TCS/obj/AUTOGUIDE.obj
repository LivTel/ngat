$ON;autoguider should be switched on (closed loop).
$OFF;autoguider should be switched off (open loop).
$SUSPEND;autoguider should continue to send corrections but TCS should ignore.
$RESUME;TCS should start applying autoguider corrections again (after a SUSPEND).
$RANK;guide star should be chosen from the field of view as that with rank.
$RANGE;guide star should be chosen from any in specified magnitude range.
$PIXEL;guide star should be nearest to specified pixel coordinates.
*double;guidemag;magnitude of the selected guide star.
