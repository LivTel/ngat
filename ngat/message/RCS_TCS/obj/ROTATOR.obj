#Instruct TCS to switch the rotator mode or move it.
%int;mode;{ SKY | MOUNT | FLOAT | VERTICAL | VFLOAT };mode of operation.
%double;position;SKY (0.00 to 360.00 degs) or MOUNT (-270.00 to +270.00 degs);sky position angles.
$SKY;position angle is relative to sky.
$MOUNT;position angle is relative to mount.
$FLOAT;rotator is not slewed from current setting on source change.
$VERTICAL;rotator is slewed to vertical position but stops tracking.
$VFLOAT;rotator is slewed to vertical and tracking engaged to keep it vertical.
