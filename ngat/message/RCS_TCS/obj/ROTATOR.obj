#Instruct TCS to switch the rotator mode or move it.
%int;mode;{ SKY | MOUNT | FLOAT | VERTICAL | VFLOAT };mode of operation.
%double;position;SKY (0.00 to 360.00 degs) or MOUNT (-270.00 to +270.00 degs);sky position angles.
$SKY;position angle is relative to sky.
$MOUNT;position angle is relative to mount.
$FLOAT;rotator is not slewed from current setting on source change.
$VERTICAL;rotator is slewed to vertical position but stops tracking.
$VFLOAT;rotator is slewed to vertical and tracking engaged to keep it vertical.
$CARDINAL;rotator is using cardinal points.
$CARDINAL_POINT_0;sky angle 0.
$CARDINAL_POINT_1;sky angle 90
$CARDINAL_POINT_2;sky angle 180
$CARDINAL_POINT_3;sky angle 270
$CARDINAL_POINT_4;sky angle 360 -same as 0
