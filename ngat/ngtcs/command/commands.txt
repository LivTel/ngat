PIXEL x y - guide by nearest star to Autoguiderpixel x,y. n m 0.00 to 20.00 r 1 to 10 x y 0.00 to 1024.00 (pixel centres range from 0.50 to 1023.50) guidemag 0.00 to 20.00 [Magnitude] - The magnitude of the guide source. 
Timeout: 200 seconds 
Errors: . BADIO An input/output error occurred within the TCS. It isadvisable to wait for the TCS state to return to OKAY before continuing. BADKEYW The supplied keyword was invalid, e.g. SUSPEND wasmisspelt. BADPARAM An argument was specified incorrectly. ENGREJECT The telescope is currently under engineering control. IGNORED The command line was blank. NETDISABLED The network command interface has been disabled by aninteractive user. NETDISALL This command has been disabled through the networkinterface. NETPARSE A parsing error occurred before the command could beexecuted. NETUNK The command was specified incorrectly and could not beidentified. OVER The command was overridden by a more recent request. STATEREJECT The command is not permitted in the current systemstate, the autoguider node is not ready to accept commands or not all relevant telescope mechanisms arein position, e.g. the node software has failed or is busy or the autoguider deployment mirror is still in motion. TIMEDOUT The command did not complete before the timeout periodhad expired. Comment: The AUTOGUIDE ON command sends a requests to the autoguider tofind a guide star in the current field of view. The parameters agmode informs the TCS which method is to be usedto select a guide star. AUTOGUIDE OFF causes the TCS to open the tracking loop and stop the Autoguider from centroiding. Autoguiding may also besuspended and later resumed using the AUTOGUIDER SUSPEND and AUTOGUIDER RESUME respectively. In suspend mode guide corrections areaccepted from the autoguider but no offset is made to the current tracking demands. The autoguider sends (x,y) pixel co-ordinates of a guide star to the telescopecontrol computer. The TCS then adjusts the telescope drives to keep the star at a given location on the autoguider CCD. If the intention is to maintain thecurrent positioning of a field (e.g. if acquisition onto a spectrograph slit has been verified), then the command AUTOGUIDE ON should be used. Thistakes the first position received from the autoguider after the command is issued, and keeps the guide star there. On the other hand, if the autoguiderco-ordinates are already known, then the appropriate command is AUTOGUIDE ON PIXEL x y. There are two cases where this is likely to be . useful. The first is when an observation is to be repeated and the field is tobe positioned at the same place on the detector. The guide probe and pixel positions should be repeated. The second case is guiding on the target objectusing a slit viewer. The x and y should be the pixel co-ordinates of the centre of the slit. Before this command is requested, an autoguider must have beenselected either using the AGSELECT command or the INSTRUMENT command. If an AUTOGUIDE ON request fails then an error message will bereturned to the TCS client. .

6.14 CALIBRATE 
Function: Update a subset of the pointing coefficients in the pointing model. 
Command Syntax: CALIBRATE calmode 
Actioned Syntax: None 
Completed Syntax: rms-error 
Arguments: calmode DEFAULT - Reverts to the default pointing solution inthe initialisation file. This is a suitable course of action if the CALIBRATE command fails (e.g. gives very largerms errors). NEW - Initiates an automatic sequence which does arestricted pointing measurement on seven `FK5' stars,, in order to update the values for the encoder zero-points in azimuth and altitude and the left-right collimation error. Stars are selected to be close to themeridian and either North or South of the zenith, depending on the initial azimuth. A range of altitudesmust be covered. The telescope is driven to the first star, pointing errors are measured and then drives tothe next star. LAST - Recalls the last pointing solution. This may beuseful if the running of the control program has been interrupted, but does not ensure very accuratepointing because the encoder zero-points may have changed rms-error 0.000 to 3600.000 [arcseconds] Calibration sky sigma, residual to least square fit forpointing model. 
Timeout: 1800 seconds

This status code is also returned if a calibrate is aborted. MECHERR The deployment of the autoguider deployment mirrorfailed to complete within the timeout period or the autoguider failed to perform a task within the timeoutperiod. NETDISABLED The network command interface has been disabled by aninteractive user. NETDISALL This command has been disabled through the networkinterface. NETPARSE A parsing error occurred before the command could beexecuted. NETUNK The command was specified incorrectly and could not beidentified. OVER The command was overridden by a more recent request. STATEREJECT The command is not allowed in the current system state. SYSCALL_ERROR An error was encountered during a system call. The TCSshould recover automatically. TIMEDOUT The command did not complete before the timeout periodhad expired. 
Comments: Create a new pointing model by driving the telescope to a position defined bythe previous model, and using the autoguider to determine pointing errors. The procedure can be summarised as: * Point and track an isolated star * Drive autoguider feed mirror to the field centre * Centre rotator by taking autoguider exposures at variousrotator position angles. * Point the telescope at a series of isolated stars from acatalogue. * Calculate pointing error using autoguider exposures. * Calculate new pointing model parameters using TPOINT. * Drive autoguider feed mirror back to field edge. * Return RMS pointing error. .

STATEREJECT The command is not permitted in the current systemstate, focusing for this focal station is not under TCS control or the control node is not currently available. TIMEDOUT The command did not complete before the timeout period . had expired. 
Comments: This command is used when the telescope focus has to be changed tocompensate for the additional optical thickness of a filter. If a DFOCUS request would result in the focus mechanism beingdriven beyond a physical limit, the command will be rejected and an error message returned. Successive DFOCUS offsets are not cumulative and are not reset bythe INSTRUMENT command. To reset the focus offset use DFOCUS 0. DFOCUS offsets are cumulative with handset focus offset but handsetfocus offsets are reset on a change of instrument. .

TIMEDOUT The command did not complete before the timeout periodhad expired. 
Comments: The focus is normally adjusted to compensate for changes in tubetemperature and altitude. The input to FOCUS is a virtual position, which should be independent of these corrections. It should not, therefore, varyfrom night to night. Use the DFOCUS command to compensate for known changes of optical path (e.g. filters). The default focus for an instrument is specified in a TCS configurationfile. The TCS configuration files are discussed in the Telescope Control System User Manual. .

Timeout: 60 seconds 
Comments: ARC: an offset in the tangent plane along axes parallel to RA and Decat the initial target position. Positive offsets imply that the right ascension and declination of the telescope both increase. The magnitude of the offseton the sky is therefore independent of declination. TIME: an incremental offset, i.e. fixed amounts are added to the RAand Dec co-ordinates. This means that the magnitude of the offset on the sky changes as a function of declination. The change in RA and DEC areassumed to be in the input co-ordinate system. Multiple OFFBY commands are not cumulative also offsets introducedthrough the TWEAK command are not reset. On source change (e.g. GOTO) offsets are reset to zero. .

OVER The command was overridden by a more recent request. STATEREJECT This command is not allowed in the current telescopesystem state. TIMEDOUT The command did not complete before the timeout periodhad expired. 
Comments: . This command causes the TCS to make a request to the MCS, tochange the telescope system state. The Master Control System may instigate the state change when the TCS registers the request if conditions arefavourable. If the state change is not possible, an explanatory error message is returned. If an OPERATIONAL ON command is successful, the telescopestate will change to OKAY or WARNING. If an OPERATIONAL OFF command is successful, the telescope system state will be STANDBY. An OPERATIONAL ON request would fail if the telescope is inengineering override, the weather is bad or there has been a telescope fault. The state model for the TCS and telescope are discussed in section 3.OPERATIONAL ON is allowed in the following system states: * STANDBY * OKAY * WARN OPERATIONAL OFF is allowed in the following system states: * STANDBY * SUSPEND * OKAY * WARN The following is a typical sequence of events during a successfulOPERATIONAL ON command. * System state is initially STANDBY * The Master Control Process removes authorisation from all clients * The on-mount computer nodes are reboot * The Computer Control Tasks on each computer node is started * The application software on each computer node is started * The hydraulic system is started * All mechanisms are enabled and driven to a home position * System state changes to OKAY or WARNING .

Its main application is to centre a large number of target objects on the slit mask, butit may also be useful for long-slit spectroscopy, especially when two objects are to be placed on the slit simultaneously. It is not advisable to usedisplacements of more than 1 arcsec or rotations of more than 0.10 degrees when autoguiding, since the guide star may be lost. Larger offsets can besplit into successive smaller ones (TWEAK offsets are cumulative), or autoguiding may be suspended whilst the CCD window is moved.
