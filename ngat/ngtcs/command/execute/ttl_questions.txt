AGCENTROID : what happens if NOT autoguiding?

AGFILTER : can I use "while( ag.get_AGD_State() == AGD_State.E_AGD_STATE_MOVING );" for checking deployment?

AGFILTER : if position = "AGD_FilterPosition.E_AGD_IR_UNSET", do I need to home or something?

AGMOVE : for AMN set, do I demand using D_AMC_AXIS_POSITION_DEMAND and get actual using D_AMC_AXIS_POSITION?  If not, what?

CALIBRATE : use current VT to create instrument-specific pointing model?

CALIBRATE : catalogue of stars to use?

ENCLOSURE : how to check for completion - state = EPT_STATE_OPEN/CLOSED?

FOCUS : does a FOCUS command reset the focus offset (DFOCUS 0)?  I think it should to avoid confusion by forgetting "DFOCUS 0".

INSTRUMENT : initialise autoguider (TCS_NW_ICD v1.7) - what does this mean?

MIRROR_COVER : does the TCS "OPER ON" command enable all SPT stuff (Secondary Mirror power enable, Axis power enable, etc.)?

MOVE_FOLD : must the TCS wait until the Fold Mirror is fully deployed before issuing a Fold Mirror position demand (port-demand)?

MOVE_FOLD : what does deploy do to the position data - does the D_SFP_PORT become unset, or does it retain the setting?  And does the fold mirror have a position if it is stowed when the TCS is started?

OPERATIONAL : what are the exact duties of the TCS for this command?

PARK : what are exact duties?  Is state still OKAY/WARN?  If so, I can just move to zenith=90, non?

SHOW : What happens if there was no CALIBRATE at the current focal station - i.e. the CALIBRATE was performed with a different inst (CCD) and then an INST change was performed?



What CIL node is the AMN on/using?  What exactly is Aux Mech (Optical)?  What's non-Optical? What is the non-Optical CIL node?

What happens if RETRIEVE_1R returns less elements than requested?

Is the E_CIL_XXR the correct sourceID for the axis SDB data?

Are the demands that are made of each axis also reported to the SDB, i.e. I set the demand on the actual ACN, but then read the demand from the SDB - is this right?

Does E_CIL_OMR report the SecondaryMirror SDB data?

Does E_CIL_OMR report the FoldMirror SDB data?

In SDB : what calendar and timesacle does the SDB use? GREGORIAN : UTC?

What systems have 2 CIL nodes - 1 rx, 1 tx, and do the corresponding messages have the same CIL node arg in the msg hdr.

Does the TCS implement the SAFE request for its subsystems, or just for its own files etc?
